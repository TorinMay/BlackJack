BlackJack
=========
1. The cards won't show up on the applet. It is probably because I used a Card array to make the deck.

2. The green felt background that I am trying to add.

3. You can jump around from file to file using classes to create a complicated program.

4. Private variables and methods can only be used in that class or file, public variables and methods can be used by any
class or file.

5. An instance is the object that is within the class.

6. Allows you to use the state and constuctor of object from a different class.

7. This is refering to the current object in your file. Super calls the class from what file you
extended to your new file.

8. State and actions

9. The graphics still confuse me. How you get pictures to show up in the spot of an array.
